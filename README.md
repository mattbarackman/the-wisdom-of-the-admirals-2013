### What is this
This is a Wisdom Garden which you, the Red Admirals, have been entrusted to
grow.

It could be a collection of markdown files with links to useful resources.

It could have the wisdom of Zee spritzed throughout it like the scent of a
beautiful rose.

It could have snippets of code that you've found valuable.

It could contain full projects that you were especially proud of.

It's up to you!


### How do we work with it?

I recommend following the [Fork and
Pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) model of
collaboration for two reasons:

1. It notifies your cohort each time a request is submitted, so they can
   see the awesome material
2. It's how most companies build software. So it's good practice!

Good luck out there!
